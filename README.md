## Getting Started

  <br/>
  [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  
If you are using **Windows OS** then you need to install git:
[Getting started with git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1. Create a new folder anywhere you want 
   * **Make sure you remember where you created it**
2. Clone the repo in the folder you just created
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jcbain/atlas-dashboard.git
   ```
3. You should now see `docker.sh` in the root folder of the cloned repo. Run this command to start the web application:
   * For Linux/MacOS
    ```sh
    sh ./docker.sh
    ```
  * For Windows you need to use the gitbash terminal
    ```sh
    sh ./docker.sh
    ```
4. Once Docker finishes initializing the web application then browser window should pop up. If nothing pops up then copy/paste this in the browser:
    ```sh
    http://localhost:3000/?step=0
    ```
